				<p>
				The dataset we are using for this project was created by <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798" target="_blank">Ruchi Bhatia</a> for public use
				on the dataset hosting website <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>. The dataset is in its 5th version and has been
				updated within the last 30 days (as of 1/25/2022). All of the data is kept within a single .csv
				file, "MoviesOnStreamingPlatforms.csv" which is approximately 506.07 KB in size. It is a truly
				vast dataset, as even though 506 KB isn't at all large, it is 506 KB of solely text. For every
				movie listed, there is data about what streaming platform it's on, it's Rotten Tomatoes rating,
				age restrictions, and the year it was released.
